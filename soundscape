So, what you’re listening to on my Soundscape is the routine of my roommate’s typical weekday 

for class. Her alarm goes off twice, and you can hear her exasperation just thinking about getting 

out of bed for classes. Next, you hear her typing on her computer as she completes her 

homework. After, you hear her flipping through her textbook and clicking a pen while she takes 

notes and does her homework. Pen clicking is her way of coping with the stress of her major. 

Then we put on classical music which is what she listens to in order to concentrate better when 

she is studying. Her favorite pianist is Chopin. Lastly, after a long day of classes and learning, 

she takes a shower to refresh her mind. You can hear her open the shower curtain and turned on 

the water to for her shower then close the curtain. 

I plan on visiting Starbucks in order to record the coffee machine brewing the coffee beans. My 

roommate must always have a daily caffeine fix to stay awake throughout her day. I also want to 

record the microwave beeping as she puts in her favorite snack of popcorn. You will hear the 

kernels popping in the microwave as they become ready for her to eat. Finally, you will hear her 

working out on the treadmill as she relieves stress from enduring a full day of classes. 

The one thing I’m concerned about is how I will layer some of these sounds to make it flow. I 

feel inexperienced using this program, especially with advanced things such as moving the 

sounds to different parts and layering them. However, I feel with time I’ll be able to catch on and 

realize it isn’t that difficult after all. Other than that, I think Audacity is a cool thing to use since 

it’s free and doesn’t really take any prior knowledge of recording to navigate.
