Living the Life of Liv

This Soundscape is about me following my roommate, Liv, throughout her day. You will see what her daily routine consists of 

for a neroscience major. At the beginning, you hear her customized iPhone alarm go off, along with her saying "ugh" in dis- 

may. She ignores it, and rustling of sheets fills the silence. Then her alarm goes off a second time and she gives in by 

saying "fine," and gets up. You hear her as she gets ready for her day. The front door open along with sounds of brushing 

teeth, a hairdryer and zipping of a backpack. These sounds go off after the door opens because they are things she does 

before leaving the dorm. The door shuts, and you hear her press the elevator button, along with the dinging of the elev-

ator and the doors opening. She receives a ping from an incoming text message. The sound of a busy street heard in the 

background as she gets her Starbucks coffee. The sound of people talking and coffee machines are heard. A motorcycle 

speeds off in the distance, then transfers back to the dorm. She's heard typing on her computer and the sound of an 

incoming email. The Kardashian theme song is in the background as she continues typing. You hear two snippets from 

different episodes before it fades into page turning  and pen clicking. Liv says, "ugh I hate this," and then she yawns. 

Page flipping and pen clicking still plays before switching into Chopin's Nocturne op. 9 No. 2. As that plays, you hear 

her opening the  microwave and sticking in food, along with the beeping of the microwave. The hum of the microwave is 

in the background now as well, along with the sounds of page flipping and pem writing. Then beeping of the microwave 

comes back and you hear Liv opening  the microwave and getting her food. She opens the shower curtain and turns on the 

shower. You can hear the water running and going into the drain. After her shower, you hear her typing out a message on 

her phone, and a ping of an incoming text. Then she resumes typing before putting her phone down for the night and yawning, 

signaling the end of her day.
